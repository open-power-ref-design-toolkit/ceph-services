  # If this is a freshly installed host where ceph is not
  # configured, we want to clear the disks.  On the other
  # hand, if ceph is configured we don't want to clear
  # the disks.   This way the playbook (and any callers)
  # can be used in a reentrant manner that does no harm
  # if it is called multiple times.
  #
  # We can't perform a check on a per device basis
  # because journal-devices are accessed as raw partitions
  # (not mounted).  So we check for mounted ceph osd devices
  # on a per host basis instead.
